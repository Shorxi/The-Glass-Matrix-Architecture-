# Architecture Overview: MVC & Solid-Flow Carrier (V5.0)

## 1. Metallo-Vitreous Composite (MVC) Matrix

The base material is a photo-structurable borosilicate glass (FOTURAN derivative),
volumetrically doped with 4.5% passivated Al-Mg particles. Each particle has a ~15 nm
corundum (Al2O3) shell, ensuring full dielectric integrity across the Z-axis.

Key effects:
- Increased fracture toughness (K_IC ~ 1.25 MPa·m^1/2).
- Effective thermal conductivity boosted from ~1.1 W/(m·K) (glass) to ~5.2 W/(m·K).
- Strong reduction of process-induced wafer breakage and thermomechanical stress.

## 2. Solid-Flow Carrier Geometry (6.0 mm)

- Die size (example): 15.0 × 15.0 mm.
- Carrier footprint: 24.0 × 24.0 mm (fan-out factor 1.6).
- Core thickness: 6.0 mm MVC glass.
- Two macroscopic 4.0 mm fluid channels traverse the carrier.
- 1.0 mm solid MVC ceiling and floor above/below the channels.

The internal U-turn manifold is realized via Selective Laser Etching (SLE), forming a
cross-mesh strictly confined to the 4.0 mm diameter envelope. This mesh induces local
micro-turbulence and amplifies heat transfer at the turnaround point.

## 3. Cooling Concept

Two variants are defined:

1. **Microfluidic MVC (thin)**  
   - Integrated HFE microchannels (48 channels, ~100 µm scale).  
   - TDP > 3,500 W/package with phase-change cooling.

2. **Solid-Flow Carrier (6.0 mm)**  
   - Two 4.0 mm macroscopic channels.  
   - Compatible with standard industrial pumps (D5/DDC).  
   - Internal SLE cross-mesh for enhanced heat extraction.

In both cases, the carrier is designed for **double-sided cooling**:
- Top: conventional or advanced die-side cooler.
- Bottom: integrated carrier-side fluid flow.

## 4. Mechanical & Electrodynamic Robustness

- Effective modulus: E_eff ~ 68.5 GPa (slightly reduced vs. pure glass, more tolerant).
- Resonance frequency: ~2,145 Hz (outside typical server fan bands).
- Power TGVs: thickened copper plating.
- Data TGVs: AJP silver + UV planarization to Ra < 0.05 µm, Z_0 ~ 50 Ω.
- Co2Z hexaferrite inserts: contactless control bus >10 GHz.
